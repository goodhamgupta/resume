      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Implemented a financial assistant with LLMs and RAG, merging insights from structured and unstructured data via SQL AST parsing. Enhanced accuracy and relevance to 70\%, reduced due diligence time by 20\%, and cut inference costs by 40\% with an on-premises LLM for structured queries.}
        \item{Implemented a Thai Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system by integrating fine-tuned OpenAI Whisper with Voice Activity Detection and Speaker Diarization. Leveraged Llama for transcript correction, achieving a significant increase in intent detection accuracy from 11\% to 17\%.}
        \item{Developed LinguaForge, a multi-cloud platform using Kubernetes to manage batch jobs, train, and serve LLMs, reducing serving costs by 40\%. Integrated SkyPilot, vLLM, and S-LoRA orchestrated LoRA Adapters for improved model performance.}

    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Implemented an engine to identify similar documents and topics using LM Jelinek Mercer Smoothing, BERT and Query Re-ranking in Elasticsearch achieving a silhouette score of 0.45.}
        \item {Implemented an unsupervised summarization model to find missing topics between two documents using GPT-2 and documents-as-graphs, leading to accuracy of 65\%. Distilled and Quantized model to a LSTM leading to an increase in inference speed by 20x. }
        \item {Implemented multi-label risk classification for regulations using MultiFit, achieving an average recall of 87\% across major classes. Deployed end-to-end pipeline using Flask, AWS Sagemaker achieving P95 inference time of under one second.}
        \item{Implemented a Knowledge graph to identify key topics and entities between upcoming legislations, helping users discover and visualize hidden relationships and build custom ontologies. Deployed system using Flask, Neo4J and Streamlit.}
        \item{Implemented a system to identify and cluster metadata such as Entities, Obligations using USE Embeddings, Flask and FAISS.}
        \item{Implemented a serverless scraping architecture using Scrapy, AWS Lambda, and Fargate scraping ability and increasing efficiency by 45\%.}
